# Repository Introduction

Welcome to our Git repository! This repository serves as the central hub for managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for our seed project, as well as housing various Helm charts. Whether you're a developer, a sysadmin, or an operator, you'll find the tools and configurations necessary to deploy and manage our infrastructure efficiently.

## About the Seed Project

Our seed project lays the foundation for various applications and services within our ecosystem. It includes essential configurations, templates, and best practices to kickstart new projects swiftly and consistently.

## Helm Charts

In addition to IaC, this repository also hosts a collection of Helm charts. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that enables us to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications. With our Helm charts, deploying and managing Kubernetes resources becomes a breeze.

## Get Started

To get started with deploying our seed project or utilizing our Helm charts, please refer to the documentation provided within each respective directory.

We encourage contributions and feedback from the community to improve and expand our infrastructure management practices. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or reach out to us with any questions or suggestions.

**Note:** This is a sample README. We will update it as required in later stages of the project.

Happy coding and deploying!
